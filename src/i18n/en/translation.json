        "description": "I have crafted several RESTful APIs focusing on functionalities such as validating addresses, detailing product offerings, and providing quotations, all in alignment with MEF (Metro Ethernet Forum) standards for seamless interoperability. These microservices are engineered using a robust technology stack that includes Spring Boot for the backend, ensuring quick, efficient development and easy deployment of complex applications. For the frontend, React JS is utilized, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface that enhances user experience. To ensure these services run smoothly in a cloud-native environment, Docker and Kubernetes are employed. Docker packages the application and its dependencies into a container, making it easy to deploy and run consistently across any environment. Kubernetes orchestrates these containers, managing their lifecycle, scaling, and fault tolerance efficiently. Security and access management are handled through Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution, which provides out-of-the-box support for managing user identities, federated logins, and securing REST APIs. Lastly, the Kong API Gateway acts as the critical entry point for all the requests to these microservices, offering an extra layer of security, traffic control, and monitoring, ensuring a scalable, secure, and efficient API ecosystem.",

        "description": "I've also created REST APIs like patient management, appointment scheduling, medical record access for a healthcare application, employing the same technological framework with an additional use of AWS S3 buckets. This suite of APIs is developed to cater to various healthcare application needs, utilizing a robust stack that includes Spring Boot for the backendâ€”facilitating rapid development and deployment of complex applicationsâ€”and React JS for the frontend, ensuring a dynamic and engaging user interface. For containerization and orchestration, Docker and Kubernetes are integral parts of the infrastructure, streamlining the deployment process and managing the application at scale across any environment. Security and access control are meticulously managed through Keycloak, offering comprehensive solutions for user authentication and authorization across the application. To enhance the application's storage capabilities, especially for handling large amounts of unstructured data such as medical images and patient records, AWS S3 buckets are integrated into the solution. S3 provides scalable, secure, and durable object storage, making it an ideal choice for storing and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere on the web. This addition not only expands the app's storage capacity but also leverages the reliability and global infrastructure of AWS to ensure data availability and integrity.",
